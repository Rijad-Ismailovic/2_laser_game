This is my first Pygame project i made for a school assignment. It took a lot of time and reaserch to understand how 
game devlopment works in Pygame. In the end, I am satisfied with what i have made.

You and your friend control 2 wizards that are bound by a laser (hence the name) and they have to fend off waves of 
zombies using that laser. How long can you surive?
This game has no ending, it is an arcade game so it goes on to infinity. 

To play the game, run the "Laser Bound" file. I made it a shortcut for ease of use.

Enjoy !!
